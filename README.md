# DSGE_mod 

A collection of Dynare models. It aims at demonstrating Dynare best practices 
and providing tractable replication files for important models that can be 
useful for further model development. 

## Replicability Issues

The headers of the respective mod-files also note obvious mistakes and typos 
in the respective papers.  

## Compatibility

These mod-files have been tested against the current unstable version, to be released
as Dynare 4.5. Compatibility with earlier versions is not guaranteed.

# Contributing your own mod-files

Contributions of replication files to this collection are highly welcomed. 
When doing do, e.g. through pull requests, please clearly line out which 
results of the original paper are replicated so that correctness can be 
verified.

Juan F. and Yao, Wen (2012): "Computing DSGE Models with Recursive 
Preferences and Stochastic Volatility", Review of Economic Dynamics, 15, pp.

1021-1026 

Includes the ```ABCD_test.m```

## Gali_2008

### Gali_2008_chapter_2.mod

Policy, Inflation, and the Business Cycle, Princeton University Press, 
Chapter 3 

### Gali_2008_chapter_5_discretion.mod 

Implements the optimal monetary policy under discretion exercise of Jordi 
Gal√≠ (2008): Monetary  Policy, Inflation, and the Business Cycle, Princeton 
University Press, Chapter 5.1.1. It shows how to use the 
```discretionary_policy``` command.

command.

Exchange Rate Volatility in a Small Open Economy", Review of Economic Studies 
72, pp. 707-734. 

This mod-file shows how to use Dynare's LaTeX-capacities

## GarciaCicco_et_al_2010.mod

Replicates the model studied in GarcÌa-Cicco, Javier and Pancrazi, Roberto and Uribe, MartÌn (2010): 
"Real Business Cycles in Emerging Countries", American Economic Review, 100(5), pp. 2510-2531.
 
It provides a replication code for the main results of the original paper for the case of Argentina. 

This mod-file shows how to use the loglinear and logdata options of Dynare.

## Hansen_1985.mod

Replicates the model studied in Hansen, Gary D. (1985): "Invisible labor and 
the business cycle", Journal of Monetary Economics 16, pp.309-327.

This mod-file shows how to use the loglinear option to get moments of 
percentage deviations without loglinearizing the model and how to use the ```
get_simul_replications.m``` file to read out simulations generated by the 
```simul_replic``` option 


## RBC_capitalstock_shock.mod

Implements a simple RBC model with a time t shock to the capital stock. 


## RBC_news_shock_model.mod

Implements a simple RBC model with additively separable utility and TFP news 
calibrated to US data. It shows how to generate IRFs to a "pure" news shock 
where an 8 period anticipated news shock does not materialize at time 0. This 
is the type of policy experiment that is for example performed in Beaudry 
Portier (2004): An exploration into Pigou‚Äôs theory of cycles, Journal of 
Monetary Economics 51, pp. 1183‚Äì1216.
